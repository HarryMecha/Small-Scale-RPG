# Small-Scale-RPG

Code can be found in Assets/Scripts

This is a project I made during my time studying Computer Science at Reigate College as my final coursework piece.

It is an RPG Style game created in C# using the Unity Game Engine, the concept of the game is to recreate many features that are recognisable to the Final Fantasy Game Series, including interactable NPC's, shop and currency system, an inventory system, turn based combat, including a small timed minigame on the attack button, different equipment for the increase of stats and differing enemy types.
